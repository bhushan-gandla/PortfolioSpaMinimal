To ensure consistency and help maintain UI standards, we were in a dire need of an internal Design System. </p> <p class="t-18">Apart from IT department, we wanted the Design System to mainly serve UI Designers and Developers. We included designing standards like specs, best practices and guidelines in different used cases. For developers, I made it easy to import the theme by building private npm packages and easy to follow instructions. In addition, to the package, I added reusable components, code snippets, icon library and live demos. From a developer point of view, I wanted adopters to be able to start using the CSS theme in a few seconds.</p><p class="t-18">I played multiple roles for this project. In a nutshell, I oversaw releases, implemented the theme CSS, created/published npm packages, designed UIs and prioritized features.</p>',
